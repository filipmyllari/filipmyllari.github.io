### How did you implement comments to blog posts?
To be able to comment on my blog posts and for other people to comment on my site I chose to link my site with disqus to be able to use their commenting system. I think that they have a very easy and smooth way of inplanting disqus to your website.

### What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?
Open Graph is a technologu that allows integration between for example Facebook and its user data and a website. Facebook is a very good way to make sure that your Open Graph works thats to their debugger that allows anyone to test their page and determine how it will appear when shared on Facebook.

### What do you think about static site generators?
I think that static site generators are good because of its speed, there are no database queries to run, no templating and no processing. Everything goes really fast and smooth. You also dont have to ahassle with the server as much as a dynamic site has to. They are suitable for projects that want fast pages which wont need to be edited live. If you dont have a huge server like facebook etc have a static server would in my opinon be better and more stable.
