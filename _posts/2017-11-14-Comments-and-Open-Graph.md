### How did you implement comments to blog posts?
To be able to comment on my blog posts and for other people to comment on my site I chose to link my site with disqus to be able to use their commenting system. I think that they have a very easy and smooth way of inplanting disqus to your website. All you have to do Is to link your website to disqus, paste in the code that disqus gives you, and then you are done. Simply as that.

### What do you think about static site generators?
I think that static site generators are good because of its speed, there are no database queries to run, no templating and no processing. Everything goes really fast and smooth. You also dont have to ahassle with the server as much as a dynamic site has to. They are suitable for projects that want fast pages which wont need to be edited live. If you dont have a huge server like facebook etc have a static server would in my opinon be better and more stable. So it totally depends on what you plan to do with your site if static is suitable to use or not.
