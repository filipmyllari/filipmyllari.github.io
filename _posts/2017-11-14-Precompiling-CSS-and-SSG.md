### What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
Compared to regular CSS I think that Modularization for different styles is 

### What do you think about static site generators?
I think that static site generators are good because of its speed, there are no database queries to run, no templating and no processing. Everything goes really fast and smooth. You also dont have to ahassle with the server as much as a dynamic site has to. They are suitable for projects that want fast pages which wont need to be edited live. If you dont have a huge server like facebook etc have a static server would in my opinon be better and more stable.
