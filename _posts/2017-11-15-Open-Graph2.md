### What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?
Open Graph is a technologi that allows integration between for example Facebook and its user data and a website. Facebook is a very good way to make sure that your Open Graph works thats to their debugger that allows anyone to test their page and determine how it will appear when shared on Facebook. In open graph I chose to have my profile picture as the picture that is being showed because its my site. I also shows my name and some information about me inside the informationtab that is being showed.
